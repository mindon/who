    <div class="info"><p><b>Arthur John Robin Gorell Milner</b> FRS FRSE (Robin Milner or A.J.R.G. Milner, born 13 January 1934 near Plymouth, died 20 March 2010 in Cambridge) was a prominent British computer scientist.</p>
    <p><b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)" target="_blank">ML</a></b> is a general-purpose functional programming language developed by Robin Milner and others in the early 1970s at the University of Edinburgh, whose syntax is inspired by ISWIM. Historically, ML stands for metalanguage: it was conceived to develop proof tactics in the LCF theorem prover (whose language, pplambda, a combination of the first-order predicate calculus and the simply typed polymorphic lambda calculus, had ML as its metalanguage). It is known for its use of the Hindleyâ€“Milner type inference algorithm, which can automatically infer the types of most expressions without requiring explicit type annotations.</p>
